Summary:
Linearsearch-Big o notation: O(n) (average case)
Advantage: items do not have be sorted
Disadvantage: slower compared to binary search

Binary search: Big o-notation: O(log n) (average case) based 2
Advantage: faster
Disadvantage: items need to be sorted

Because binary search is faster, then we would like to sort it items

Insertion sort—average case O(n2)
After you move the item, is the item in its final position—NO
If you don’t have to move an item in a “step”, are you done? –NO
You need (n-1) steps

Selection sort-- average case O(n2)
After you move the item, is the item in its final position—Yes
If you don’t have to move an item in a “step”, are you done? –NO
You need (n-1) steps

Bubble sort—average case O(n2)
After you move the item, is the item in its final position—Yes
If you don’t have to move an item in a “step”, are you done? –Yes
You need (n-1) steps or less!!
